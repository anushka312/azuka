Azuka is not another tracking app; it is a **daily decision system** designed to align female fitness with biological reality. Most systems fail women by expecting physiological consistency; Azuka replaces rigid planning with **biological awareness**, adapting workouts, nutrition, and recovery based on real-time hormonal and lifestyle signals.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 1. Daily Readiness Engine

Evaluates cycle phase, symptoms, sleep, and stress to determine a daily "state."

* **Actionable Guidance:** Decides whether to push, maintain, or recover.
* **Dynamic Framing:** Adjusts mental and physical goals based on current hormonal capacity.

### 2. Adaptive Workout & Nutrition Planning

* **Smart Scheduling:** A 7-day plan that shifts with the menstrual cycle and automatically recalibrates for missed sessions.
* **Food Vision:** Camera-based macro estimation and phase-aligned meal suggestions.
* **Craving Decoder:** Contextualizes cravings through the lens of blood sugar and cycle patterns rather than "willpower."

### 3. Intelligent Recovery

* **Streak Protection:** Re-plans automatically to avoid the "broken streak" psychology.
* **Ingredient-Based Recipes:** Generates meals based on on-hand ingredients that support current hormone needs.
